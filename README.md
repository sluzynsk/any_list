# AnyList for Linux

This is a quick [Tauri](https://tauri.app) based wrapper around the excellent [AnyList](https://www.anylist.com) application.

No ownership or interest in AnyList by the author is implied by the creation of this wrapper. It was created largely out of self-interest.

## Why this wrapper?

AnyList is fantastic; they ship Mac, Apple IOS, and Android versions of their application. Desktop users other than Mac users are left with the web version, which requires a subscription to access. This wrapper does not bypass that requirement - it is simply a convenience for those who may wish to have an "app" rather than a webpage. 

The web version of AnyList works quite well; however, I do not like leaving browser tabs pinned or creating site-specific browsers.

This wrapper was developed on [EndeavourOS](https://www.endeavouros.com), an [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) based distribution that has a nice GUI installer. The AppImage works on my system and the .deb runs correctly on Ubuntu 22.04. I have not tested any other releases because that is all I have kicking around the house.

I do not build a Mac version because AnyList ships their own.

I am not currently building a Windows version because I do not have a Windows PC available to build on or test with.
