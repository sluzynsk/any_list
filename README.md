# AnyList Desktop for Windows and Linux

This is a quick [Tauri](https://tauri.app) based wrapper around the excellent [AnyList](https://www.anylist.com) application.

No ownership or interest in AnyList by the author is implied by the creation of this wrapper. It was created largely out of self-interest.

## Why this wrapper?

I really like AnyList. They currently ship Mac, Apple IOS, and Android versions of their application. Desktop users other than Mac users are left with the web version, which requires a subscription to access. This wrapper does not bypass that requirement - it is simply a convenience for those who may wish to have an "app" rather than a webpage. 

The web version of AnyList works quite well; however, I do not like leaving browser tabs pinned.

The AppImage and .deb run correctly on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04.

This code will compile and run correctly under Windows 11; I am not testing on older versions.

I do not build a Mac version because AnyList ships their own.
